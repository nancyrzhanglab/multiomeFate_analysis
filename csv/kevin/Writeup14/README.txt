Hi 
@Kevin
 I compared my data matrix with the notes you provided: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uC3xpcDfzl5SQn9cxin4kNcRIcb0w1T3a1Mk2T1yaUw/edit?tab=t.0 It seems from the seurat RData file, the priming setting has 13,586 cells and the plastic setting has 13,435 cells, however, in the notes, you recorded that the priming setting has 13,435 cells and the plastic setting has 13,586 cells.
I have saved both priming and plastic cospar output to csv files.
